# Markov Name Generator
## Overview
By analysing 3 seperate databases of Pokemon names, pharmaceuticals and ancient philosophers the program will generate a random name based on the structure of the analysed data.

I wanted to get some practice with AI programing, and I was also about to start a new DnD campaign and thought I could combine the two. The subject matter for the names came from Twitch Streamer Sean "Day 9" Plott, who would posit the question "Pokemon, pharmaceutical, or philosopher" whenever he would enounter an unusual name when playing online games.
