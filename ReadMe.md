# Markov Name Generator
## Overview
By analysing 3 seperate databases of Pokemon names, pharmaceuticals and ancient philosophers the program will generate a random name based on the structure of the analysed data.

I wanted to get some practice with AI programing, and I was also about to start a new DnD campaign and thought I could combine the two. The subject matter for the names came from Twitch Streamer Sean "Day 9" Plott, who would posit the question "Pokemon, pharmaceutical, or philosopher" whenever he would enounter an unusual name when playing online games. 

I chose to write the program in Python because dictionaries make organizing the seperate links of the Markov chain much clearer since looking up objects is simpler in Python as compared to a language like C. Python also requires fewer includes, with built in CSV parsing the only module I needed to include was Random so that each link of the chain could be randomly selected.
